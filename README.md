# Metro Train Data Mining Project

## Introduction

This repository contains the code and documentation for a data mining project focused on the Metro train dataset. The project involves various data analysis and modeling tasks to extract insights and make predictions based on the provided dataset.

## Dataset Overview

The dataset used in this project consists of the following details:

- Total Entries: 1,516,948
- Columns: 17
- Data Types: Integer, Float, Object

The dataset columns include information about timestamps, various sensor readings, and other relevant parameters.

## Project Steps

Here is an overview of the key steps undertaken in this project:

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** We began by conducting EDA to gain insights into the dataset. This involved summarizing statistics, identifying missing values, and exploring data distributions.

2. **Data Preprocessing:** Data preprocessing is critical to ensure the dataset is clean and ready for analysis. 
3. **Z-Score Normalization:** we applied Z-score normalization for analog sensors to standardize the data, making it suitable for further analysis and modeling.

4. **Data Visualization:** We utilized various visualization techniques like heatmaps and time series plots to visualize the data and identify patterns, correlations, and trends.

5. **Regression Model:** A regression model was developed to predict oil temperature and motor current based on the sensor readings.

6. **Logistic Model:** We built a logistic regression and Random Forest models for failure detection. This model can help identify potential failures or issues in the Metro train system by analyzing sensor readings.
